# Problem Statement

## 5. Airport Traffic Flow Prediction (Graph ML)

**Problem:**  
Model global airport connectivity and predict high-congestion airports using graph-based ML.  

**Dataset:**  
OpenSky ADS-B Flight Data  

**How to Approach:**  
- **Baseline:** Clustering on airport traffic  
- **Advanced:** Graph Neural Networks for prediction  

**Bonus Points:**  
- Visualize airport network with interactive graph  
- Predict cascading delays: if JFK is congested, which airports are next?  
- Add a simulation of rerouting strategies
