# Problem Statement-

5. Airport Traffic Flow Prediction (Graph ML)
Problem: Model global airport connectivity and predict high-congestion airports using graph-based ML.
Dataset: OpenSky ADS-B Flight Data.
How to Approach:
Baseline: Clustering on airport traffic.
Advanced: Graph Neural Networks for prediction.
Bonus Points:
      Visualize airport network with interactive graph.
      Predict cascading delays: if JFK is congested, which airports are next?
      Add a simulation of rerouting strategies.
